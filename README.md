# Audio Copilot
Audio Copilot enables the interaction with content during playback on-going. It will help transform the passive listening into an interactive, engaging and real-time experience. It can understand the on-going playback intelligently and be ready for userâ€™s query at any time. 

## Functions implemented
- Interrupt the playback and ask for question
- Control the player by voice commands. e.g. 'stop', 'resume'...
- Search News by google integrated by SERPAPI
