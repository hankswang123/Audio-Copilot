Imagine a peaceful nursery filled with soft pastel colors and gentle sunlight streaming through the window. In the center, a tiny infant lies sleeping in a cozy crib, wrapped in a fluffy, warm blanket. Chubby cheeks and tiny fingers peek out, and a small teddy bear sits nearby, watching over the baby. The room is calm and serene, with a mobile of stars slowly spinning above, casting dreamy shadows on the walls.
