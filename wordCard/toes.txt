Imagine a sandy beach where the warm, golden sun has just begun to rise, casting a soft glow. A pair of small, playful toes are peeking out from beneath the sand, surrounded by tiny seashells and delicate footprints. Nearby, gentle waves lap at the shore, leaving a trail of seafoam. The scene captures the playful innocence of a child enjoying a serene morning by the sea.
