Imagine a bustling school cafeteria filled with lively students. Long tables are lined with colorful trays, each holding a variety of foods like juicy apples, steaming pasta, and golden chicken nuggets. Some kids are laughing with friends, while others are engrossed in their books. In the background, a friendly lunch lady serves food with a warm smile, and outside the large windows, sunshine pours in, casting a cheerful glow over the entire room.
