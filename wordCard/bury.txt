Imagine a peaceful, sunlit meadow where a gentle breeze rustles the tall grass. In the center, a small group of friends gathers around a freshly dug hole in the soft earth. They are burying a time capsule filled with letters, photos, and trinkets for future generations to discover. Nearby, colorful wildflowers bloom, and butterflies dance in the air, symbolizing hope and the passage of time.
