Imagine a calm, quiet pond in a lush, green forest. The water is still, reflecting the clear blue sky and the soft, fluffy clouds above. Suddenly, a small pebble is thrown into the pond, creating gentle ripples that move outward in perfect circles. Each "plop" of the pebble breaking the surface is a moment of serene beauty, with tiny droplets sparkling in the sunlight as they fly up and fall back into the water.
