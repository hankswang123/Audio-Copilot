Imagine a peaceful forest floor, carpeted with soft moss and fallen leaves, where small, hidden burrows peek out from the earth. Sunlight filters through the tree canopy, casting dappled shadows over the forest. A family of curious rabbits emerges from one burrow, their ears twitching and noses sniffing the fresh air. Nearby, other burrows house tiny creatures like hedgehogs and field mice, each bustling with life in this secret underground world.
