Imagine a lush, green jungle where different creatures are evolving over time. On one side, tiny fish are growing legs, crawling onto the land to become lizards. In the trees above, small feathered dinosaurs are gradually developing into colorful birds, spreading their wings to fly. Each layer of the jungle tells a story of change, showing the magical journey of life as it adapts and transforms across the ages.
