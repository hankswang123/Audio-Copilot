Imagine a warm summer afternoon in a lush, green meadow filled with colorful wildflowers. A group of tiny flies buzz around, glinting like little jewels in the sunlight. Nearby, a crystal-clear stream gently flows, reflecting the blue sky and fluffy white clouds. The flies dance in playful patterns above the water, their wings creating a soft hum that blends with the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze.
