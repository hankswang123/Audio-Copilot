Imagine a bright and cheerful nursery filled with soft pastel colors. There are fluffy animal-themed rugs on the floor and walls adorned with smiling clouds and friendly stars. A gentle rocking chair sits by the window, where sunlight streams in, casting warm patterns on the floor. Shelves overflow with colorful toys and books, and a cozy crib with a mobile of twinkling stars sways gently, creating an inviting and peaceful atmosphere for a baby.
