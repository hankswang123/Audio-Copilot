Imagine a bustling marketplace under the warm glow of a golden sunset. Stalls overflow with colorful fruits, vibrant flowers, and handcrafted trinkets, while people of all ages wander through, chatting and laughing. The air is filled with the scent of spices and the sound of music played by a street performer. A gentle breeze carries the laughter of children playing nearby, and a friendly dog trots by, its tail wagging in delight.
