Imagine a cozy little café on a rainy day, where a young barista with a warm smile is serving a cup of steaming hot chocolate to an elderly lady. The barista gently places the cup on the table, nodding politely and chatting kindly with the lady. The café is filled with the calming aroma of freshly baked pastries and soft music playing in the background. Outside, people walk with colorful umbrellas, and the rain softly taps on the windows, creating a peaceful and polite atmosphere.
