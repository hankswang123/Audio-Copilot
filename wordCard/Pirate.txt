Imagine a colorful scene on a sunny, blue ocean. A pirate ship with tattered sails and a skull-and-crossbones flag sails through the calm waters. On the deck, a lively crew of pirates, wearing eye patches, bandanas, and striped shirts, sing cheerful sea shanties. Nearby, a treasure chest spills over with glittering gold coins and sparkling jewels, while a parrot perches on the pirate captain's shoulder, squawking happily.
