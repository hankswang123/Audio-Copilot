Imagine a vast, snowy landscape under a clear blue sky, where a majestic caribou stands proudly on a gentle hill. Its thick, velvety fur glistens in the sunlight, and its large, intricate antlers rise like a crown. Nearby, a group of other caribou graze peacefully, their breath visible in the crisp air. In the background, tall pine trees are dusted with snow, and a distant mountain range looms, creating a serene and magical winter scene
