Imagine a sunny meadow filled with wildflowers of every color, where a group of children and puppies are playing joyfully. The kids are laughing, their faces glowing with happiness, as they chase each other through the tall grass. Puppies bound alongside them, their tails wagging and ears flopping with every leap. Butterflies dance in the air, and the sun casts a warm, golden light over the entire scene, making everything feel alive and full of energy.
