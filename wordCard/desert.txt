Imagine a vast desert stretching as far as the eye can see, with golden sand dunes rolling like waves under a bright, cloudless blue sky. The sun is high and its rays make the sand shimmer, creating a mirage in the distance that looks like a shimmering lake. A lone camel with a colorful saddle stands silently, casting a long shadow. In the background, a small oasis with a cluster of palm trees offers a splash of green against the endless sea of sand.
