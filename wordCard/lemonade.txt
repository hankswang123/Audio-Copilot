Imagine a sun-drenched summer afternoon in a small, charming town. A young girl with bright eyes and a wide smile runs a lemonade stand at the edge of her flower-filled garden. The table is decorated with a cheerful yellow tablecloth, and a large glass pitcher filled with ice-cold lemonade glistens in the sunlight. Nearby, bees buzz around the sweet scent of freshly cut lemons, while neighbors gather to enjoy the refreshing drink and share laughter under the shade of a big oak tree.
