Imagine a peaceful garden filled with a variety of lush green shrubs. Each shrub is uniquely shaped, with some small and round, while others are tall and bushy. Bright flowers peek through the greenery, adding splashes of red, yellow, and pink. In the background, a gentle breeze rustles the leaves, and a small bird perches on one of the branches, singing a sweet melody.
