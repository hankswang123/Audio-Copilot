Imagine a vibrant underwater world where angelfish glide gracefully through crystal-clear waters. These fish, with their striking patterns of electric blue, yellow, and black, swim among colorful coral reefs and swaying seaweed. Sunlight filters down from above, casting a shimmering glow on their delicate fins. Nearby, small bubbles rise to the surface, and tiny sea creatures dart in and out of hiding places, creating a lively and enchanting aquatic scene.
