In a sunlit desert scene, picture a tiny jerboa hopping gracefully across the golden sands. Its long, slender legs stretch out like springs, while its tufted tail balances its every move. Nearby, a small cactus casts a gentle shadow, and a few scattered rocks provide a backdrop. The sky is a brilliant blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, creating a peaceful and lively atmosphere.
