In a sunlit forest clearing, a small, shiny acorn rests gently on a bed of soft, golden leaves. Surrounding it are tall, mighty oak trees with branches swaying in a gentle breeze. A curious squirrel with a fluffy tail sits nearby, eyeing the acorn with interest. The scene is peaceful and warm, with beams of sunlight filtering through the leaves, casting playful shadows all around.
