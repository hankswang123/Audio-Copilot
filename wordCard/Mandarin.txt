Imagine a vibrant, bustling street market in a busy city in China. Stalls are filled with fresh mandarins, their bright orange color shining under the warm morning sun. People are smiling as they haggle with vendors, and the air is filled with the sweet citrus scent of the fruit. In the background, you can see traditional Chinese lanterns hanging from strings, adding a festive and lively atmosphere to the scene.
