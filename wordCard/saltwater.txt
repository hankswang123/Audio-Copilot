Imagine a serene beach at sunrise, where the gentle waves of the saltwater ocean kiss the golden sands. The sky is painted in soft hues of pink and orange, and a flock of seagulls gracefully glide above the water. Nearby, a small sailboat lazily drifts on the calm sea, its sails catching the cool morning breeze. The salty air is filled with the soothing sound of waves and the distant laughter of children playing along the shore.
