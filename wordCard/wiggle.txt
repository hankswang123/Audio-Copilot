Imagine a little worm wiggling happily through a lush, green garden. Its tiny body moves in curvy waves, leaving a trail on the soft, damp earth. Colorful flowers sway in the gentle breeze as the sun shines warmly, casting playful shadows. Nearby, a curious ladybug watches the worm's joyful dance with fascination, creating a scene full of life and movement.
