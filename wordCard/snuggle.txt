Imagine a cozy winter evening inside a small, warmly lit cabin. A big, fluffy cat snuggles next to a little girl on a soft, colorful blanket in front of a crackling fireplace. The girl, with a gentle smile and rosy cheeks, holds a steaming mug of hot cocoa, topped with tiny marshmallows. Outside the window, snowflakes dance gently to the ground, creating a peaceful, dreamy atmosphere.
