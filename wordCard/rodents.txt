Picture a bustling, miniature city hidden beneath the forest floor where rodents wear tiny clothes and hats. It's a sunny day, and the streets are alive with activity as mice ride bicycles made of twigs and squirrels sell acorns from little stands. In the background, a band of chipmunks plays cheerful tunes on instruments crafted from leaves and bark. Above, colorful banners hang between the branches, celebrating the arrival of spring in this lively, hidden world.
