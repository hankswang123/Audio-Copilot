Imagine a tiny fairy garden hidden beneath a large, ancient oak tree. The leaves form a protective canopy overhead, letting in just enough sunlight to make the dewdrops sparkle like diamonds. In this miniature world, delicate flowers the size of a fingernail bloom, and a small stream winds its way through moss-covered stones. Little creatures, no bigger than a grain of rice, flit around, tending to their magical home with care and joy.
