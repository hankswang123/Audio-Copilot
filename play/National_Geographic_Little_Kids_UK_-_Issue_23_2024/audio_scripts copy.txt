Speaker 1: 01:45
That's right, every animal is unique, just like us. Now get ready to be amazed by jumping spiders. Jumping spiders, they can jump super high, high, wow, they have 8 eyes and each eye has a different job. Incredible, like tiny superheros.

Speaker 1: 03:21
in a cat on a roof, it's on top, you got it, it's fun.

Speaker 2: 03:25

Speaker 2: 03:54
What else can they do .

Speaker 1: 03:56
what they like to dig for what for food, they eat bugs and grubs? I know it sounds gross.

Speaker 2: 04:03
but it's yummy for them. Okay, let's do something else.

Speaker 1: 04:05
Like what?

Speaker 2: 04:06
I want to go on a treasure hunt.

Speaker 1: 04:07
Oh, me too. Yeah, let's look in this magazine .

Speaker 1: 04:21
Jewels and gold coins .

Speaker 2: 04:22
and maybe a magic lamp? That'd be cool. I want to be a pirate .

Speaker 1: 04:26
arc maybe. Oh, he there. Okay, let's go back in time to the time of the dinosaurs. This dinosaur is called minmi minmi.

Speaker 2: 04:35
what a funny name.

Speaker 1: 04:36
I know it was a plant eater.

Speaker 2: 04:38
did it have big teeth?

Speaker 1: 04:39
Nope, small and sharp for biting off plants .

Speaker 2: 04:43
and it had armor .

Speaker 1: 04:44

Speaker 2: 04:52
Sri Lanka.

Speaker 1: 04:52
where's that? It's an island in the Indian Ocean.

Speaker 2: 04:55
Wow, that sounds exotic.

Speaker 1: 05:10
that's pretty, there's a special rock in Sri Lanka called Lion Rock.

Speaker 2: 05:14
Why is it called Lion Rock?

Speaker 1: 05:16
Because it looked like a giant lion. There's an old palace on top, an old palace from a long time ago .

Speaker 2: 05:22
that's so cool.

Speaker 1: 05:23
and there's a park called Y'all National Park.

Speaker 2: 05:25
what kind of animals live there? Leopards, leopards, those are my favorite.

Speaker 1: 05:29
My 2, they're so graceful .

Speaker 2: 05:31
and they have spots .

Speaker 1: 05:32
just like our spotty cat club.

Speaker 2: 05:34
We should start a leopard club.

Speaker 1: 05:35
Great idea.

Speaker 2: 05:36
What else can you see in Sri Lanka?

Speaker 1: 05:38
You can see fishermen balancing on stilts in the water, still like long poles.

Speaker 2: 05:43
Why do they do that?

Speaker 1: 05:44
So they can reach the fish.

Speaker 2: 05:46
that sounds hard.

Speaker 1: 05:47
It does take a lot of balance.

Speaker 2: 05:48
They must be really good at it.

Speaker 1: 05:50
They are, let's climb a mountain.

Speaker 2: 05:52
Okay, which one?

Speaker 1: 05:53
Adam's peak, It's a special mountain in Sri Lanka.

Speaker 2: 05:56
why is it special?

Speaker 1: 05:57
Lots of people climb it at night, at night, so you can see the stars while they walk.

Speaker 1: 07:20
Learning new things is always an adventure .

Speaker 2: 07:22
and these magazines were full of surprises .

Speaker 1: 07:24

Speaker 2: 07:30
That's a tough one.

Speaker 1: 07:31
There are so many to choose from.

Speaker 2: 07:32
I think I would pick a dolphin.

a dolphin.

Speaker 2: 07:35
they're so playful and smart .

Speaker 1: 07:37
and they live in the ocean. Yeah.

we could swim together.

Speaker 1: 07:40
that would be amazing.

Speaker 2: 07:41
What about you?

Speaker 1: 07:43
I would choose a monkey.

Speaker 2: 07:44
a monkey, yeah.

Speaker 1: 07:45
we could swing through the trees .

Speaker 2: 07:47
and eat bananas .

Speaker 1: 07:48
and make funny faces.

Speaker 2: 07:49
That sounds like a lot of fun.

Speaker 1: 07:51
It does this.
