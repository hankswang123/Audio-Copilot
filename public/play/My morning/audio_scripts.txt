Hi everyone, welcome. Today we're going to talk about something we all do our mornings. 

发言人2   00:05
Yes, like a little adventure before school or playing starts. We have some pictures here showing what a morning might look like. 

发言人1   00:12
Okay, let's look at the little tasks, our morning checklist. So first thing is waking up, the page says get up. 

发言人2   00:19
time to open your eyes. 

发言人1   00:21
Can you all try saying get up? Good. 

发言人2   00:25
that's it. So getting up is step 1. 

发言人1   00:27
starting the day right. And after getting up, what do we do to get ready? Let's see the list again, Okay, wash my face. 

发言人2   00:37
yes, splash some water, helps you feel fresh and awake. 

发言人1   00:39
makes you feel clean too, then right after you usually brush my teeth. 

发言人2   00:43
got to keep that smile super bright, up and down, side to side. 

发言人1   00:47
just like the song says, keep those teeth healthy. 

发言人2   00:49
Exactly, very important. 

发言人1   00:51
And what's next on the list? Let's see, get dressed. 

发言人2   00:55
yep, time to put on our clothes, shirt, pants, maybe a dress. 

发言人1   00:58
head to our toes on our outfits. 

发言人2   01:01
now we're really getting ready for the day. 

发言人1   01:02
There's even a little song here, it's kind of fun, it goes morning, morning, good morning, up, get up, up and down, brush my teeth. 

发言人2   01:10
sped, splash, wash my face. 

发言人1   01:12
head to toe, get dress ready. 

发言人2   01:13
ready I'm ready. 

发言人1   01:15
Should we try singing it together? Maybe just the actions up, up, brush, brush splashed. 

发言人2   01:21
yeah, that helps, remember the order. 

发言人1   01:24
Okay, now let's look at someone specific. Shenton, this page says shenton's morning. 

发言人2   01:29
let's see what Shenton does first. 

发言人1   01:32
Shenton says good morning mom, Oh, that's lovely. 

发言人2   01:35
a really nice way to start the day saying hello to family. 

发言人1   01:38
then mom says brush your teeth, good reminder, and Shenzhen says okay, mom, I brush my teeth and then wash my face, look just like our checklist. 

发言人2   01:47
see? Brushing teeth, washing face. 

发言人1   01:49
common morning things, then mom says hurry up and get dressed, getting ready for the day . 

发言人2   01:53
and Shenton says good morning Shenzhen. 

发言人1   01:57
maybe shes is looking in the mirror or talking to a favorite toy . 

发言人2   02:01
could be it's okay to say good morning to yourself too, makes you feel happy . 

发言人1   02:05
so after getting dressed, what happens? Let's see, oh dad says have breakfast shenxi . 

发言人2   02:14
breakfast, very important fuel for the body . 

发言人1   02:17
and Shenton says I'm coming, let's go . 

发言人2   02:20
breakfast gives us energy right for learning and playing all day . 

发言人1   02:24
exactly need that energy, look here. 

发言人2   02:26
Shenzhen is all ready for school, Shenton says I'm ready for school. 

发言人1   02:30
dad ready to go . 

发言人2   02:31
and then tells mom, yes mom, I get dressed and then brush my teeth, wait a second. 

发言人1   02:36
oh what is it? 

发言人2   02:38
Shenzhen got dressed before brushing teeth this time? 

发言人1   02:41
I see, so the order changed a little bit, yeah. 

发言人2   02:44
and you know what, that's okay, sometimes we might do things a bit differently, maybe brush teeth first one day, get dressed first the next day. 

发言人1   02:51
that's absolutely right, the important thing is that we do these things to get ready. The order isn't always the same for everyone or even every day. 

发言人2   02:57
so we have a question here for you listening in the morning, what do you do? 

发言人1   03:01
Yeah, think about your own morning, what comes first for you getting dressed, brushing. 

发言人2   03:06
do you eat breakfast with your family, what does your morning look like? It's interesting to think about our own habits. 

发言人1   03:12
We could even make our very own my morning checklist, like draw pictures. 

发言人2   03:16
Oh, that's a great idea, A drawing of getting up, a drawing of brushing teeth. 

发言人1   03:21
yes, and put them in the order you do them. Then you can look at it each morning, it's like your own special morning guide. 

发言人2   03:27
like a fun game to help you remember. 

发言人1   03:29
I like that, wow. So we learned quite a bit about mornings today, getting up. 

发言人2   03:34
washing faces. 

发言人1   03:35
brushing teeth, getting dressed and having breakfast, saying good morning, lots of little steps. 

发言人2   03:40
all helping us get ready for a wonderful day of learning and playing. 

发言人1   03:44
and it's really neat that everyone might have their own little order and that's perfectly fine. 

发言人2   03:49
The main goal is just getting ourselves ready and feeling good for the day ahead. 

发言人1   03:53
So maybe tomorrow morning, think about your routine, what will you do first, what comes next? You could even draw it. 

发言人2   04:02
keep exploring your mornings, you're all doing a great job, getting ready each day.
