Speaker 1: 00:00
Hey everyone, welcome to another Deep Dives. Today we'll be taking a look at something a little bit different. Different. We're going to be looking at a first grade English textbook from China. Oh wow, so this is, you know, we've looked at textbooks before on the show, but I think this one is going to be really, really fun and interesting.

Speaker 2: 00:16
Yeah I'm really excited to jump into this one.

Speaker 1: 00:18
Yeah, so as always, just to reiterate for our listeners, you know, we've both done our research on this textbook and as always, you know, we come to these deep dives without any strong opinions or anything like that.

Speaker 2: 00:29
Yeah, just ready to explore and see what we find Exactly.

Speaker 1: 00:33
yeah. So let's jump right in. So this textbook, as I mentioned, is for first graders in China, and it's all about you teaching them English. I think one of the things that really struck me right away was just how much emphasis there is on fun and games and stories.

Speaker 2: 00:48
Yes, it's really refreshing to see that approach, you know, it's not just about memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary. It's about making learning an enjoyable experience .

Speaker 1: 00:59
back your own, you know, early education experiences. I'm sure the things that stand out the most are the things that were fun and engaging.

Speaker 2: 01:06
absolutely the things that sparked our curiosity and made us want to learn more.

Speaker 1: 01:09
exactly. So let's take a look at some of the specific units in this textbook. Unit 7 is called After School Fun, and it's all about, you know, those classic games that kids love to play.

Speaker 2: 01:21
Like, what kind of games are we talking about?

Speaker 1: 01:23
Well, they've got games like move and freeze, hide and seek, throw sandbags and skip rope.

Speaker 2: 01:28
Oh wow, those are classics. It's amazing how those games transcend cultures, you know, children all over the world enjoy playing those same games.

Speaker 1: 01:36
Yeah, it's like a universal language of play. And what I think is really clever is how they've incorporated English learning into these games. So for example, with Move and freeze, they have instructions like touch your head or jump three times.

Speaker 2: 01:49
so they're getting those action verbs and numbers in there, exactly.

Speaker 1: 01:52
and it's all disguised as fun.

Speaker 2: 01:54
I love that sneaky learning.

Speaker 1: 01:56

It's great that they're incorporating multimedia elements, it's so important to engage multiple senses when you're learning, especially for young learners.

Speaker 1: 02:13
Yeah, it keeps things interesting and helps them to remember what they're learning. And then to top it all off, they have a mini project where students are encouraged to invite their friends to play the games they've learned.

Speaker 2: 02:24
That's a great way to encourage social interaction and teamwork.

Speaker 1: 02:28
Yeah, it's all about learning through play and having fun with your friends.

Speaker 2: 02:32
I wish all textbooks were like this.

Speaker 1: 02:33
I know, right? Okay, let's move on to unit 8, which is called traffic safety.

Speaker 2: 02:38
Okay, a very important topic, especially for young children.

Speaker 1: 02:41
Absolutely. This unit introduces keywords like go stop, traffic light, and zebra crossing.

Speaker 2: 02:47
Those are essential vocabulary words for anyone learning about road safety .

Speaker 1: 02:51
and to make it fun, they've even created a traffic light song.

Speaker 2: 02:54

Speaker 2: 03:01

Speaker 1: 03:03
head for sure. And then they also have a dialogue between a mother and child crossing the road.

Speaker 2: 03:07
so they're showing the real life application of those traffic rules .

Speaker 1: 03:10
exactly the child is excited about an ice cream shop and the mother is patiently reminding them about safety.

Speaker 2: 03:17
That's a scenario that many parents can relate to.

Speaker 1: 03:20
definitely, yeah. And to make it even more interactive, they have a helping the Police Officer mini project where students act out different traffic scenarios.

Speaker 2: 03:29
that's a great way for them to practice what they've learned and develop their problem solving skills.

Speaker 1: 03:34

Animals, Okay, this sounds fun, it is.

Speaker 1: 03:48
this unit introduces vocabulary words like tiger, panda, and monkey.

Speaker 2: 03:54
those are some familiar and loveable animals, I bet the kids love learning about them.

Speaker 1: 03:57
Oh yeah, and they have a really cut that like this, what do you see? I see a panda looking at me.

Speaker 2: 04:03

Speaker 1: 04:13
Well, the child asked, are you a cat? And the panda replies, no I'm a bear.

Speaker 2: 04:39
So they're encouraging creativity and self expression.

Speaker 1: 04:41
Definitely, they're given the freedom to choose their favorite animal and design their own bookmark.

Speaker 2: 04:46
It's amazing how much learning they've packed into just one unit.

Speaker 1: 04:49
I know, right, it's really impressive. Okay, last but not least, let's take a look at unit 10, which is called I Like Toys.

Speaker 2: 04:56
Toys, this brings back memories.

Speaker 1: 04:58
Me too. This unit focuses on vocabulary words like ball, toy, boat, toy train, toy car, and kite.

Speaker 2: 05:07
Those are some classic toys that are popular all over the world.

Speaker 1: 05:10
It's a reminder that no matter where you're from, kids love to play with toys and of course they have another fun chant in this unit. What is it, it goes like this? Toy toy. Which toy do you like? A kite or a car? A boat or a ball?

Speaker 1: 07:53
and then in unit 8, helping the police officer mini project where the students get to act out different traffic scenarios.

Yeah, the music is so catchy and upbeat, it really adds to the whole learning experience .

Speaker 1: 08:32
and it helps the kids to remember the vocabulary and grammar points.

Speaker 2: 08:35

Speaker 1: 08:39
probably. Yeah, it's just so darn catchy.

Speaker 2: 08:42
but it's not all about songs and games. This textbook also has some really heartwarming stories.

Speaker 2: 08:50
Oh yeah, that one was so sweet, it's a great way to introduce kids to themes of friendship and saying goodbye.

Speaker 1: 08:56
And it also helps them to develop their emotional intelligence.

Speaker 1: 09:23
It gets them thinking about what would make someone else happy.

Speaker 2: 09:26
exactly, is it like a mini lesson in kindness and compassion?

Speaker 1: 09:30
You know, I think one of the things that makes this textbook so effective is that it really understands how kids learn.

Speaker 2: 09:35
Yeah, it's not just about cram and information into their heads. It's about creating experiences that are fun and engaging and meaningful.

Speaker 1: 09:44
And it's about connecting learning to their lives and their interests.

Speaker 2: 09:47
right? Like they're learning about animals and traffic safety and toys, but they're also learning about friendship and kindness and how to be a good person.

Speaker 1: 09:56
It's like they're learning about life through the lens of English.

Speaker 2: 09:58
Yeah, and think that's what makes this textbook so special. It's not just about teaching English, it's about using English as a tool to explore the world and to connect with others.

Speaker 1: 10:08
