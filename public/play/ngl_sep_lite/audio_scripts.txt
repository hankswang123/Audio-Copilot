00:00 
 Welcome to our deep dive, everyone. Today we're going to be talking all about animals.

00:03 
 Oh, I love animals. Are we going to see some cool pictures?

00:07 
 Yes, we are going to see some cool pictures and learn some new words, too.

00:10 
 Awesome. I'm ready.

00:11 
 Okay, so first, let's look at this owl.

00:14 
 Ooh. Look at its big eyes.

00:16 
 Yeah, Owls have really big eyes. They need them to see at night.

00:20 
 Why do they need to see at night? Is that when they hunt?

00:22 
 That's right. Owls sleep during the day and they wake up at night to hunt.

00:26 
 What do they hunt for?

00:26 
 They hunt for small animals like mice and voles.

00:29 
 Those owls are so cool. So where do these owls live?

00:32 
 These owls live in England.

00:34 
 England? Can you point to England on the map for me?

00:38 
 Sure. England is this island right here. Can you say England?

00:41 
 England.

00:42 
 Great job. Yeah. Okay, now, look at this funny little animal.

00:45 
 It's pink and it has a shell.

00:48 
 That's right. This is a Pink Fairy armadillo.

00:52 
 Pink Fairy armadillo. Wow, that's a big word.

00:55 
 Can you say armadillo?

00:56 
 Armadillo. That's hard to say.

00:57 
 You got it. Now, this armadillo is very, very small. It's only about as long as your hand.

01:02 
 Wow, that's tiny.

01:03 
 And see that shell on its back? That shell helps protect the armadillo from danger.

01:09 
 Oh, like a little shield.

01:10 
 Yeah, just like a little shield. And look at those big claws.

01:13 
 I see them. What are those for?

01:15 
 It uses those claws to dig tunnels in the sand.

01:18 
 Tunnels? Why does it need tunnels?

01:20 
 It lives in those tunnels. That's where it sleeps and hides from predators.

01:23 
 That's pretty smart.

01:24 
 Yeah.

01:24 
 So where does this Pink Fairy armadillo live?

01:27 
 This Pink Fairy armadillo lives in Argentina.

01:29 
 Argentina. Can you point to that on the map too, please?

01:32 
 Of course. Argentina's way down here in South America. See?

01:36 
 Oh, wow. That's far away.

01:38 
 Now, let's talk about colors. What color is this parrot?

01:41 
 Orange.

01:42 
 Yep. Can you think of other things that are orange?

01:45 
 Hmm, let me think. Pumpkins are orange.

01:49 
 Good one.

01:50 
 Oh, and basketballs are orange.

01:51 
 That's right. Okay, now, look at this cute little baby.

01:54 
 Oh, it's a baby monkey.

01:55 
 Yes. It's a baby orangutan with its mommy.

01:58 
 Orangutan. What's an orangutan?

02:01 
 An orangutan is a type of ape. They live in the rainforest, and they are very good at climbing trees.

02:06 
 Wow. Why is the baby holding onto its mommy?

02:09 
 Baby orangutans stay with their mommies for a long time. The mommies teach Them everything they need to know about surviving in the rainforest.

02:16 
 That's nice. They learn how to climb trees and find food?

02:19 
 Yep. They even learn how to build nests in the trees then.

02:23 
 Nests? Like birds?

02:24 
 Yeah, kind of like birds. They make their nests out of leaves and branches high up in the trees.

02:29 
 Cool. So where do these orangutans live?

02:31 
 Orangutans live on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.

02:35 
 Borneo and Sumatra. I don't know where those are.

02:38 
 Let me show you on the map. Borneo and Sumatra are these islands right here in Southeast Asia.

02:43 
 Oh, I see.

02:44 
 Okay, are you ready for a game?

02:45 
 Yes. I love games. What game are we gonna play?

02:48 
 We are gonna play a matching game. Look at this walrus that has a funny thing on its face. It's called a mustache.

02:55 
 A mustache. Can I try to spell that word?

02:57 
 Sure.

02:58 
 M U S T A C H e. Mustache.

03:02 
 You got it. Now, look at this porcupine. What are those sharp, pointy things on its back?

03:07 
 Those look pokey. What are they called?

03:09 
 Those are called quills.

03:10 
 Quills. How do you spell that?

03:12 
 Q, U, I, L, L, S. Quills. The quills help protect the porcupine from predators.

03:17 
 So if another animal tries to attack the porcupine, it gets poked by the quills?

03:21 
 Exactly. Now, look at this penguin. What is covering its body?

03:25 
 Feathers.

03:26 
 That's right. Birds have feathers. Can you spell feathers?

03:29 
 F, E A T H E R S. Feathers.

03:32 
 Great job. Now, let's look at this animal. It has big horns on its head.

03:36 
 Wow. Those are big horns. What is that animal called?

03:39 
 That's called an ibex.

03:40 
 Ibex. I B, E X.

03:43 
 Exactly. And last but not least, look at this monkey. It has long, pointy teeth called tusks.

03:49 
 Tusks. Wow. What does it use its tusks for?

03:52 
 Monkeys use their tusks to eat fruit and to protect themselves from danger.

03:56 
 So tusks are like special teeth?

03:57 
 That's right. Okay, now let's learn about hyenas.

03:59 
 Hyenas? Are those the animals that kind of look like dogs, but they're not dogs?

04:03 
 That's right. Hyenas are not dogs, but they are related to dogs. And they live in big families called clans.

04:09 
 Clans? What's a clan?

04:11 
 A clan is a group of animals that live together and help each other.

04:14 
 Oh, so they're like a team?

04:15 
 Exactly. They work together to hunt and to protect their territory.

04:19 
 That's cool. So where do these hyenas live?

04:22 
 Hyenas live in many parts of Africa, including a country called Botswana.

04:26 
 Botswana. Can we see that on the map?

04:28 
 Sure. Botswana is right here in southern Africa.

04:30 
 Oh, I see it. Are there other animals that live in Botswana too?

04:34 
 Yes, lots of other animals live in Botswana. Like bat eared foxes.

04:38 
 Bat eared foxes? What are those?

04:40 
 Bat eared foxes are small foxes with really big ears.

04:43 
 Oh, I bet they can hear really well then.

04:45 
 And lions live in Botswana, too.

04:47 
 Wow, lions. Those are big and scary.

04:50 
 And zebras with their black and white stripes.

04:52 
 Zebras are cool. I like their stripes.

04:53 
 And hippos, too.

04:54 
 Hippos. Those are the ones that love to swim, right?

04:56 
 That's right. Hippos spend a lot of time in the water to stay cool.

05:00 
 That's a good idea.

05:01 
 Okay, are you ready for another game?

05:03 
 Yes. What's this game about?

05:05 
 This game is about land animals and water animals. Can you tell me which animals live on land and which animals live in the water?

05:14 
 Sounds fun. I think I can do that.

05:15 
 Okay, first up is the giant panda. Land or water?

05:19 
 Giant panda. I think pandas live on land.

05:23 
 You're right. Giant pandas live in the mountains of China. And they eat bamboo.

05:27 
 Cool.

05:28 
 Okay, what's next?

05:29 
 Next is an orca. Land or water orca?

05:32 
 Oh, that's a whale. Orcas live in the water.

05:35 
 That's right. Orcas are sometimes called killer whales, but they are actually dolphins.

05:39 
 Whoa, I didn't know that.

05:40 
 How about a clownfish? Land or water clownfish?

05:45 
 I think those live in the water, too.

05:46 
 Yep, you're on a roll. Clownfish live in coral reefs and they are very colorful.

05:51 
 Okay, my turn to ask. How about a giraffe? Land or water h?

05:56 
 A giraffe. Giraffes have long necks so they can reach leaves high up in the trees. So that means they live on land. You got it. How about an emu?

06:04 
 Land or water emu? That's the kind of bird. Right, But I don't think emus can fly.

06:08 
 That's right. Emus can't fly. But they can run really fast. So where do they live?

06:11 
 On land?

06:12 
 Exactly. Now it's my turn again. How about a monkey? Land or water monkey?

06:16 
 Monkeys live in trees, so they live on land.

06:19 
 Good job. You're getting so good at this.

06:21 
 I know. It's fun.

06:22 
 Okay, how about a crayfish? Land or water crayfish? That sounds like a water animal to me.

06:30 
 That's right. Crayfish live in freshwater rivers and lakes.

06:33 
 Okay, last one. Sea star. Land or water sea star.

06:39 
 Where do you think stars live?

06:40 
 In the water.

06:41 
 You got it. Sea stars live in the ocean and they come in lots of different colors.

06:44 
 I love sea stars. They're so pretty.

06:47 
 Me too. Now, let's look at this deer. It has big antlers on its head.

06:51 
 Wow. Those antlers are huge. What kind of deer is that?

06:54 
 This is called a roe deer.

06:55 
 A roe deer. Can you say that again, please?

06:57 
 Roe deer. Can you say roe deer?

06:58 
 Roe deer.

06:59 
 Good job. Now do you know why male roe deer have antlers?

07:04 
 Is it to protect themselves?

07:06 
 Yes, but they also use their antlers to fight other male roe deer.

07:10 
 Why do they fight?

07:11 
 They fight to show who is stronger and to win the attention of female roe deer.

07:15 
 So it's like a competition?

07:17 
 Exactly. Where do you think roe deer live?

07:19 
 Are they in Africa too?

07:20 
 Nope. Roe deer don't live in Africa. They live in Scotland, England and Wales.

07:24 
 Scotland, England and Wales. Are those all in the same place?

07:27 
 They are. They are all countries that are part of the United Kingdom.

07:30 
 Can you show me on the map?

07:32 
 Sure. Scotland, England, and Wales are all located on this island right here.

07:35 
 Oh, wow. So the roe deer live close to the owls.

07:38 
 That's right. Okay, are you ready to go back in time to meet a dinosaur?

07:42 
 Dinosaurs? Yes. I love dinosaurs.

07:45 
 This dinosaur is called Corthosaurus.

07:47 
 Corythosaurus. What a funny name. Can you say that again slowly, please?

07:52 
 Corythosaurus.

07:53 
 Corythosaurus. Wow. That's hard to say. What did it look like?

07:56 
 Corythosaurus was a big plant eating dinosaur with a long neck and a big crest on its head.

08:02 
 A crest? What's a crest?

08:04 
 A crest is a bony plate that sticks up from the top of the head. Look. You can see in this picture.

08:10 
 Whoa. It looks like a helmet.

08:12 
 Scientists think Corthosaurus might have used its crest to make loud sounds.

08:16 
 Like to talk to other Corthosaurus?

08:18 
 Maybe. Or maybe it used its crest to attract mates.

08:21 
 That's a cool dinosaur. I want to see more dinosaurs.

08:23 
 We'll see more dinosaurs another time. Now let's play one last game for today.

08:27 
 Okay, I'm ready to play.

08:29 
 Look at these pictures. Can you find the pictures whose names end with the letter T?

08:33 
 Hmm, let me see. Bat ends with a T. Yes.

08:38 
 Good job.

08:39 
 And tent ends with a T. You got it. And peanut ends with a T. That's three.

08:44 
 You found all the pictures that end with the letter T? You are a word detective. Yay. Now get ready to meet some more amazing animals. These are our wild cards.

08:53 
 Wild cards? How does that mean?

08:55 
 Wild cards are animals that are extra special and have unique features and adaptations.

08:59 
 Oh, cool. Like superpowers?

09:01 
 Kind of like superpowers. First up is the arctic wolf.

09:04 
 Arctic wolf? What's arctic?

09:06 
 Arctic means very cold and icy. The Arctic wolf lives in a very cold place.

09:11 
 So it must have a thick coat to stay warm.

09:13 
 That's right. Arctic wolves have thick white fur that helps them blend in with the snow and stay warm in freezing temperatures.

09:19 
 Oh, that's smart. What else do we have?

09:21 
 Next is the Japanese macaque.

09:23 
 J Japanese macaque? What's a macaque?

09:25 
 A macaque is a type of monkey that lives in Japan.

09:27 
 What's special about this monkey?

09:29 
 Japanese macaques are famous for taking baths in hot springs.

09:33 
 Baths in hot springs. That sounds relaxing.

09:35 
 It does. And then we have a very special fish called a harlequin ghost pipefish.

09:40 
 A harlequin ghost pipefish. Wow. That's a long name. What does it look like?

09:45 
 This fish is a master of camouflage. It has a long, thin body and it can change its color to match its surroundings.

09:53 
 Wow, that's cool. So that's like a ghost in the ocean.

09:56 
 Exactly. And we have a tiny frog called a spring peeper.

09:59 
 A spring peeper? Why is it called that?

10:01 
 Because it makes a beeping sound that you can hear in the springtime.

10:04 
 Oh, so it's a singing frog. That's cute.

10:06 
 And then we have a bird called a red bellied woodpecker.

10:09 
 A woodpecker? What does it do?

10:10 
 Woodpeckers use their strong beaks to peck holes in trees.

10:15 
 Why do they do that?

10:16 
 They peck holes in trees to find insects, to eat and to make nests.

10:20 
 Oh, that's smart. They use their beaks like tools.

10:22 
 And last but not least, we have the pronghorn.

10:25 
 The pronghorn? What's a pronghorn?

10:27 
 A pronghorn is a type of antelope that lives in North America.

10:31 
 What's special about the pronghorn?

10:32 
 The pronghorn is one of the fastest land animals in the world.

10:35 
 Wow. I bet it can run super fast.

10:38 
 It can run up to 60 miles per hour.

10:40 
 That's amazing. I wish I could run that fast.

10:43 
 Me too. Well, those are all our wild card animals for today.

10:46 
 Wow. We saw so many amazing animals today. I learned so much.

10:50 
 Me too. It's incredible how diverse the animal kingdom is.

10:54 
 Yeah. There are so many different animals all.

10:56 
 Over the world, and each animal has its own special adaptations that help it survive in its environment.

11:01 
 That's what makes them so cool. It's so cool how all these different animals can survive in so many different places.

11:07 
 I know. It's amazing, right? Like, how does that tiny little pink fairy armadillo Stay safe.

11:12 
 Oh, that's a good question. Well, remember how it has that hard shell on its back?

11:17 
 Yeah. It's pink, right?

11:17 
 Yeah. Well, that pink shell actually helps it blend in with the sand in Argentina, where it lives.

11:23 
 So it's like camouflage.

11:24 
 Exactly. It's like hiding in plain sight. And that shell is really strong too. It protects the armadillo from predators.

11:29 
 So it's like a little pink tank?

11:31 
 Uh huh. Yeah, kind of. And don't forget those big claws, they help it dig those burrows where it lives.

11:36 
 Oh yeah, that's right. It's like its own little underground fortress.

11:39 
 Now let's talk about those owls again. Remember we said that they hunt at night? Yeah.

11:43 
 They're nocturnal, right?

11:44 
 Yep. And they have these amazing eyes that can see really well in the dark.

11:49 
 So they can see their prey even when it's super dark out?

11:52 
 Exactly. They can spot a tiny little mouse from far away even if there's barely any light.

11:57 
 Wow, that's like a superpower.

12:00 
 It is pretty amazing. And their feathers are special too.

12:03 
 What's special about their feathers?

12:05 
 They're super quiet. Quiet? When owls fly, they don't make any noise.

12:09 
 Oh, wow. So they can sneak up on their prey without being heard?

12:12 
 That's right. They're like silent ninjas of the night.

12:17 
 Okay, now let's talk about those cute baby orangutans again.

12:20 
 Oh yeah, the ones that live in the rainforest.

12:22 
 Yep. Remember how they learn everything from their mommies? Yeah.

12:25 
 It's like they go to jungle school.

12:27 
 It is. And they stay with their moms for a long time.

12:30 
 Why do they stay with their moms for so long?

12:32 
 Because they have so much to learn. Like how to climb trees, how to find food, how to build nests.

12:37 
 Oh yeah, those nests high up in the trees. They're pretty cool.

12:41 
 They are. And it takes a long time for the baby orangutans to learn how to do all those things.

12:46 
 That's why they need their mommies to teach them.

12:48 
 Exactly. You know, hyenas are a lot like that too.

12:51 
 Hyenas? You mean the ones that live in clans?

12:53 
 Yep. They live in big family groups and they work together to survive.

12:57 
 Oh yeah, that's right. It's all about teamwork with hyenas.

13:01 
 And remember how we said that female hyenas are the leaders of their clans?

13:05 
 Yeah, girl power.

13:07 
 The females are bigger and stronger than the males and they lead the hunts and protect the territory.

13:12 
 It's kind of like those owls we talked about. They're both nighttime hunters.

13:17 
 That's true. But owls are Solitary hunters, which means they hunt alone.

13:22 
 And hyenas are pack hunters. Which means they hunt together.

13:25 
 That's right. Different animals have different strategies for survival.

13:28 
 It's so cool how nature works.

13:30 
 Speaking of cool, remember that Corythosaurus dinosaur we talked about?

13:34 
 Yeah, the one with the big crest on its head.

13:36 
 Yep. Do you remember what scientists think that crest was for?

13:41 
 I think he said it might have been for making sounds.

13:44 
 That's right. They think Corythosaurus might have used its crest to make loud calls.

13:49 
 Like to talk to other Korathosaurus. Or to attract mates.

13:53 
 Exactly. It's like a built in trumpet.

13:55 
 That's so cool. I wish I had a crest on my head.

13:58 
 Uh huh. Maybe not. Speaking of those wild card animals.

14:01 
 Oh yeah. Those were awesome.

14:03 
 I know which one was your favorite.

14:06 
 That's a tough one. I think I liked the harlequin ghost pipefish the best.

14:10 
 Oh yeah. The one that can change its color to match its surroundings.

14:13 
 Yep. That was so cool. It's like it disappears right into the coral.

14:17 
 I know. It's like magic.

14:19 
 And I like the spring peeper frog too. The one that sounds like sleigh bells.

14:22 
 Huh. Me too.

14:23 
 Yeah.

14:24 
 It's amazing how such a tiny frog can make such a loud sound.

14:27 
 I know, right? Nature's full of surprises.

14:29 
 It really is.

14:30 
 It really is. It's like all the animals in the world fit together.

14:33 
 Yeah. Like a big puzzle. And we got to learn about so many of those puzzle pieces today.

14:37 
 I know. And I learned some new words too.

14:39 
 Me too. It's so much fun to learn new words.

14:42 
 Yeah. Do you remember when we matched those animals to their body parts?

14:46 
 Oh yeah. Like the walrus with its mustache. Can you spell mustache again?

14:50 
 M U S T A C H e mustache.

14:54 
 And the porcupine with its quills. Q U I L L s. And.

15:00 
 The penguin with its feathers. F E A T H E R.

15:03 
 S. We saw so many cool animals. Which wild card animal did you like the best?

15:10 
 That's a hard one. There were so many good ones.

15:12 
 I know, right?

15:13 
 Okay, okay. I. I think my favorite was the Arctic wolf.

15:16 
 Oh yeah. The one that lives in the really cold place.

15:18 
 Yep. And it has that thick white fur to stay warm.

15:21 
 It's like a big fluffy snowball.

15:23 
 What about you? What was your favorite?

15:26 
 I think I like the Japanese macaques the best.

15:28 
 Oh yeah. The monkeys that take baths in the hot springs.

15:31 
 Yep. It just sounds so relaxing.

15:33 
 I know, right? I wish I could take a bath in a hot spring.

15:36 
 Maybe someday we can.

15:37 
 That would be awesome.

15:38 
 Well, that's all the time we have for today. But before we go, we have a challenge for you.

15:42 
 Ooh, a challenge. I love challenges. What is it?

15:45 
 Think about all the animals we talked about today. Which one was your favorite?

15:48 
 Yeah, which one did you like the best?

15:51 
 Maybe you loved learning about owls. Or maybe you thought the pink fairy armadillo was super cool.

15:57 
 Or maybe you really like the corythosaurus dinosaur.

16:00 
 Whichever animal you like the most, we encourage you to go learn more about it.

16:04 
 Yeah, you can read books about it or watch videos.

16:08 
 You could even ask your teacher or your parents to help you learn more.

16:11 
 There's so much to learn about animals.

16:14 
 The world is full of amazing creatures just waiting to be discovered.

16:17 
 So keep exploring and keep learning. And never stop being curious.

16:21 
 Thanks for joining us on this deep dive. We'll see you next time.

16:24 
 Bye, everyone.
