Speaker 1: 00:00 
 Hey there, explorers. Welcome to our deep dive. Today.

Speaker 2: 00:03 
 Uh, yeah.

Speaker 1: 00:04 
 We're going to learn all about some cool animals.

Speaker 2: 00:06 
 Cool?

Speaker 1: 00:07 
 From a magazine. Kind of like the ones you might read at home.

Speaker 2: 00:09 
 Oh, yeah, like National Geographic, Little Kids Magazine.

Speaker 1: 00:12 
 Exactly.

Speaker 2: 00:13 
 It has lots of colorful pictures and fun facts about animals.

Speaker 1: 00:16 
 Yeah. And this is the November December issue.

Speaker 2: 00:19 
 That's right.

Speaker 1: 00:20 
 So let's get started. First up, we have zebras. Look at this picture.

Speaker 2: 00:26 
 Oh, wow.

Speaker 1: 00:26 
 They have black and white stripes all over their body.

Speaker 2: 00:29 
 Yeah. They're so cool.

Speaker 1: 00:31 
 Did you know those. Those stripes aren't just for looking cool. They actually help zebras stay healthy.

Speaker 2: 00:38 
 Oh. How do they do that?

Speaker 1: 00:39 
 Well, you know flies, Those little buzzing bugs. They can bite zebras and make them sick.

Speaker 2: 00:43 
 Oh, no.

Speaker 1: 00:44 
 But the stripes, they confuse the flies.

Speaker 2: 00:47 
 Really?

Speaker 1: 00:47 
 Yeah. Makes it hard for them to land on the zebra.

Speaker 2: 00:49 
 Wow.

Speaker 1: 00:50 
 So the flies fly away to find another animal.

Speaker 2: 00:53 
 That's a neat trick.

Speaker 1: 00:54 
 I know, right? So the zebras stay healthy.

Speaker 2: 00:56 
 Smart stripes.

Speaker 1: 00:58 
 Okay. Now let's travel to the high mountains.

Speaker 2: 01:00 
 Ooh.

Speaker 1: 01:01 
 Where we can find a very special goat called a markhor.

Speaker 2: 01:05 
 A markhor? What's that?

Speaker 1: 01:06 
 Well, what makes the markhor special is that it has really long horns.

Speaker 2: 01:11 
 Long horns.

Speaker 1: 01:12 
 And guess what? The horns twist like a giant corkscrew.

Speaker 2: 01:15 
 Whoa. A corkscrew?

Speaker 1: 01:17 
 Yep. They use their horns to help them climb steep rocks.

Speaker 2: 01:19 
 Oh. Can you imagine climbing a mountain with twisty horns?

Speaker 1: 01:23 
 Markhors are amazing climbers.

Speaker 2: 01:26 
 They are.

Speaker 1: 01:26 
 And look, they have these funny beards too.

Speaker 2: 01:28 
 Oh, yeah.

Speaker 1: 01:29 
 It's like a grandpa goat.

Speaker 2: 01:30 
 Haha. A grandpa goat with corkscrew horns.

Speaker 1: 01:33 
 Okay, let's fly over to Antarctica now.

Speaker 2: 01:35 
 Ooh.

Speaker 1: 01:36 
 Where it's super cold and icy. There we can find a bird that loves the snow.

Speaker 2: 01:41 
 A bird that loves snow?

Speaker 1: 01:42 
 It's called a snow petrel.

Speaker 2: 01:43 
 A snow petrel? Never heard of that one.

Speaker 1: 01:46 
 They are very good at catching fish.

Speaker 2: 01:48 
 Oh.

Speaker 1: 01:48 
 They use their beaks, which are kind of like their mouths, to grab fish from the ocean.

Speaker 2: 01:53 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 01:53 
 Sometimes they fly above water to look for fish. And sometimes they stand on the ice and wait.

Speaker 2: 01:58 
 So patient.

Speaker 1: 01:59 
 And they even build their nests high up on icy cliffs.

Speaker 2: 02:02 
 Wow. Can you imagine living in such a chilly place?

Speaker 1: 02:05 
 Brr. I'm glad we're just visiting.

Speaker 2: 02:07 
 Me too.

Speaker 1: 02:08 
 Speaking of cold places, have you ever tried to walk in really deep snow?

Speaker 2: 02:13 
 Yeah, it's hard.

Speaker 1: 02:14 
 It's hard. But there's an animal called a snowshoe hare.

Speaker 2: 02:18 
 A snowshoe hare that has special feet.

Speaker 1: 02:21 
 That make it easy to walk on snow.

Speaker 2: 02:22 
 Oh, special feet.

Speaker 1: 02:24 
 Their feet are big and covered in fur to keep them warm.

Speaker 2: 02:27 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 02:28 
 And they have something called webbing.

Speaker 2: 02:30 
 Webbing.

Speaker 1: 02:31 
 Which means their toes are connected by skin, like a duck's foot.

Speaker 2: 02:35 
 Oh, like a duck.

Speaker 1: 02:36 
 And the webbing helps them walk on top of the snow without sinking.

Speaker 2: 02:40 
 Wow.

Speaker 1: 02:41 
 It's like wearing snowshoes. So quick, imagine hopping through the snow without sinking.

Speaker 2: 02:44 
 That would be so fun.

Speaker 1: 02:46 
 Now let's meet an animal that's super big.

Speaker 2: 02:48 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 02:49 
 And can live both on land and in water.

Speaker 2: 02:51 
 Bo.

Speaker 1: 02:52 
 It's called a walrus.

Speaker 2: 02:53 
 A walrus. Those have tusks, right?

Speaker 1: 02:55 
 Yes. Look at those big tusks.

Speaker 2: 02:56 
 Wow. They look like giant teeth.

Speaker 1: 02:58 
 Walruses have thick skin to help them stay warm in cold water.

Speaker 2: 03:02 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 03:03 
 And they have flippers, which are like arms and legs that help them swim. Cool. So what are those tusks for?

Speaker 2: 03:09 
 Well, they use them for lots of things.

Speaker 1: 03:11 
 Like what?

Speaker 2: 03:12 
 They use them to pull themselves out of the water and onto the ice.

Speaker 1: 03:15 
 Okay.

Speaker 2: 03:16 
 And they also use them to protect themselves from danger and to dig for food in the sand.

Speaker 1: 03:21 
 Oh, like clams.

Speaker 2: 03:23 
 Exactly. Walruses love to eat clams.

Speaker 1: 03:28 
 Cool.

Speaker 2: 03:28 
 And get this. They even use their whiskers to feel around for food. It's like having extra fingers.

Speaker 1: 03:34 
 That's amazing.

Speaker 2: 03:35 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 03:36 
 So they use their whiskers to find clams under the sand.

Speaker 2: 03:38 
 No. They are so cool.

Speaker 1: 03:40 
 Okay. Are you ready for a trip to outer space?

Speaker 2: 03:42 
 Outer space?

Speaker 1: 03:43 
 Let's zoom over to Venus.

Speaker 2: 03:44 
 But Venus?

Speaker 1: 03:45 
 A planet that's even hotter than a pizza oven.

Speaker 2: 03:47 
 Hotter than a pizza oven?

Speaker 1: 03:49 
 Venus is the brightest planet in our sky.

Speaker 2: 03:52 
 It is.

Speaker 1: 03:52 
 And it's covered in clouds. But these clouds are different from the clouds we see on Earth.

Speaker 2: 03:58 
 How are they different?

Speaker 1: 03:59 
 They're thick and trap heat from the sun, which makes Venus super hot.

Speaker 2: 04:03 
 Wow. Imagine a whole planet that's super hot.

Speaker 1: 04:06 
 I wouldn't want to visit there.

Speaker 2: 04:07 
 Me neither. It's amazing how different planets can be from Earth.

Speaker 1: 04:11 
 I know, right?

Speaker 2: 04:12 
 Welcome back. Are you ready for more amazing animals?

Speaker 1: 04:16 
 You bet. What cool creature do we have next?

Speaker 2: 04:19 
 Have you ever heard of a mandrill?

Speaker 1: 04:23 
 A mandrill? I don't think so.

Speaker 2: 04:24 
 Well, they're really cool because they're the largest kind of monkey.

Speaker 1: 04:27 
 The biggest monkey. Wow. What does it look like?

Speaker 2: 04:30 
 Mandrills are famous for being very colorful.

Speaker 1: 04:34 
 Colorful?

Speaker 2: 04:34 
 Their faces are red and blue, and they have colorful stripes on their bottoms, too.

Speaker 1: 04:38 
 Wow. They must.

Speaker 2: 04:40 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 04:41 
 Where do these mandrills live?

Speaker 2: 04:42 
 Mandrills live in the forests of Africa.

Speaker 1: 04:45 
 The forests?

Speaker 2: 04:46 
 You can find them swinging from trees and looking for food. Down on the forest floor.

Speaker 1: 04:51 
 What kind of food do mandrills like to eat?

Speaker 2: 04:53 
 Well, mandrills eat both plants and animals.

Speaker 1: 04:55 
 Plants and animals.

Speaker 2: 04:56 
 When an animal eats both plants and animals, we call that an omnivore.

Speaker 1: 05:00 
 Omnivore.

Speaker 2: 05:00 
 So a mandrill is an omnivore.

Speaker 1: 05:02 
 Okay, got it.

Speaker 2: 05:03 
 They munch on yummy fruits and seeds and bugs.

Speaker 1: 05:05 
 Oh, yummy.

Speaker 2: 05:06 
 And sometimes they even eat small reptiles like lizards.

Speaker 1: 05:09 
 Lizards. Wow. It sounds like mandrills have quite the appetite. Let's move on to an animal you might have seen before. The mallard duck.

Speaker 2: 05:19 
 Oh yeah, mallards.

Speaker 1: 05:20 
 Mallards are a type of duck that you can find all over the world.

Speaker 2: 05:23 
 That's right. They live near water like ponds, lakes and rivers.

Speaker 1: 05:26 
 Yeah, I've seen mallards at the park before.

Speaker 2: 05:29 
 They love to swim.

Speaker 1: 05:30 
 They do? They have that shiny green head and a bright yellow beak.

Speaker 2: 05:33 
 Exactly.

Speaker 1: 05:34 
 What do they find to eat in the water?

Speaker 2: 05:35 
 Well, mallard ducks are omnivores, just like mandrills.

Speaker 1: 05:38 
 Oh wow. Another omnivore.

Speaker 2: 05:40 
 They eat plants and seeds in the water.

Speaker 1: 05:42 
 Okay.

Speaker 2: 05:43 
 And they also gobble up small insects.

Speaker 1: 05:45 
 Insects?

Speaker 2: 05:45 
 And even tiny snails that live in the water.

Speaker 1: 05:48 
 Snails. Yuck.

Speaker 2: 05:49 
 It's amazing how animals are so good at finding food no matter where they live.

Speaker 1: 05:53 
 I know, right? Whether it's a forest or a lake.

Speaker 2: 05:56 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 05:57 
 There's always something tasty to eat. Speaking of animals that know how to survive, let's take a look at the purple sea urchin.

Speaker 2: 06:04 
 A purple sea urchin?

Speaker 1: 06:06 
 Purple sea urchin. What in the world is that? I've never heard of it.

Speaker 2: 06:10 
 It's a really interesting creature that lives in the ocean.

Speaker 1: 06:13 
 The ocean? It's shaped like a ball.

Speaker 2: 06:16 
 A ball?

Speaker 1: 06:16 
 And is covered in sharp spines.

Speaker 2: 06:18 
 Spines?

Speaker 1: 06:19 
 To protect it from other animals that might want to eat it.

Speaker 2: 06:21 
 So it's kind of like an underwater cactus?

Speaker 1: 06:23 
 Uh huh.

Speaker 2: 06:24 
 And what color is it?

Speaker 1: 06:25 
 What color do you think it is?

Speaker 2: 06:27 
 Is it purple?

Speaker 1: 06:28 
 You got it. It's purple.

Speaker 2: 06:29 
 So cool. How do they move around with all those pointy spines? It seems like that would make it hard to get around.

Speaker 1: 06:34 
 Well, purple sea urchins have these tiny little feet called tube feet.

Speaker 2: 06:39 
 Tube feet?

Speaker 1: 06:40 
 That they use to slowly crawl along the ocean floor.

Speaker 2: 06:43 
 Wow. So it's like a slow motion walking cactus underwater. That's amazing. Okay, what other amazing animal do we have to meet?

Speaker 1: 06:51 
 Get ready to learn about a very special wild cat called a caracal.

Speaker 2: 06:56 
 A caracal?

Speaker 1: 06:57 
 Ever heard of it?

Speaker 2: 06:57 
 I've never heard of a caracal before. What makes it so special?

Speaker 1: 07:00 
 Caracals are known for their really long ears.

Speaker 2: 07:03 
 Long ears?

Speaker 1: 07:03 
 Their ears have tufts of fur at the tips.

Speaker 2: 07:06 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 07:06 
 Making them look extra long. We call those tufts of fur tufted ears.

Speaker 2: 07:11 
 Tufted ears.

Speaker 1: 07:12 
 Those ears help them hear even the tiniest sounds. Wow. I bet that comes in handy when they're hunting.

Speaker 2: 07:17 
 You're exactly right. Caracals can hear small animals like mice and birds moving around in the grass.

Speaker 1: 07:23 
 Wow. So it's like their ears are a radar to help them find food.

Speaker 2: 07:26 
 Exactly. Exactly. And guess what? Caracal kittens grow up really quickly.

Speaker 1: 07:30 
 Oh, how quickly?

Speaker 2: 07:31 
 By the time they are 10 months old.

Speaker 1: 07:32 
 10 months old?

Speaker 2: 07:33 
 They can hunt on their own.

Speaker 1: 07:34 
 Wow. 10 months old. That's like being a teenager in the animal world.

Speaker 2: 07:38 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 07:39 
 Okay, I'm ready for our next animal. What do we have?

Speaker 2: 07:42 
 Let's learn about an animal that looks like a mix of different animals.

Speaker 1: 07:46 
 Okay.

Speaker 2: 07:46 
 Have you ever heard of a raccoon dog?

Speaker 1: 07:48 
 A raccoon dog? Is it a raccoon or a dog? I'm so confused.

Speaker 2: 07:53 
 It's a little bit of both. Both raccoon dogs are wild animals that are part of the same family as foxes and wolves.

Speaker 1: 08:00 
 Foxes and wolves.

Speaker 2: 08:01 
 But their faces look a lot like raccoons.

Speaker 1: 08:03 
 So they are like a combination of different animals.

Speaker 2: 08:06 
 Exactly.

Speaker 1: 08:06 
 How cool.

Speaker 2: 08:07 
 They have a bushy tail like a fox.

Speaker 1: 08:09 
 Okay.

Speaker 2: 08:10 
 A pointy nose like a dog. And a black mask around their eyes just like a raccoon.

Speaker 1: 08:16 
 It's like nature decided to take the best parts of different animals and put them all together.

Speaker 2: 08:20 
 I know, right?

Speaker 1: 08:21 
 What a cool combination it is. I wonder how they came up with the name raccoon dog.

Speaker 2: 08:25 
 Me too.

Speaker 1: 08:26 
 Where do raccoon dogs live?

Speaker 2: 08:27 
 Raccoon dogs live in forests and grasslands in parts of Asia and Europe.

Speaker 1: 08:33 
 Forests and grasslands.

Speaker 2: 08:35 
 And remember how we learned that mandrills are omnivores?

Speaker 1: 08:37 
 Yes.

Speaker 2: 08:38 
 Because they eat both plants and animals. Well, raccoon dogs are omnivores too, so they eat everything.

Speaker 1: 08:44 
 That makes sense. Because if you live in a lot of different places, you need to be able to find food everywhere.

Speaker 2: 08:49 
 Yeah. They're very adaptable.

Speaker 1: 08:51 
 I love learning about all these amazing animals. What do we have next?

Speaker 2: 08:55 
 Let's hop over to meet a very colorful frog, the strawberry poison frog.

Speaker 1: 09:00 
 Strawberry poison frog? Why is it called a poison frog?

Speaker 2: 09:04 
 Because it has poison in its skin.

Speaker 1: 09:06 
 Poison? Is it dangerous?

Speaker 2: 09:08 
 It is a little bit dangerous, but don't worry. It won't hurt you if you don't touch it.

Speaker 1: 09:12 
 Okay, good. I'll be sure to keep my hands to myself. But why is it Called a strawberry.

Speaker 2: 09:16 
 Poison frog because it is bright red, just like a strawberry.

Speaker 1: 09:20 
 Oh. I bet that bright red color is a warning to other animals that it is dangerous to eat it.

Speaker 2: 09:27 
 That's right.

Speaker 1: 09:27 
 It's like a big sign that says, don't eat me.

Speaker 2: 09:29 
 You are exactly right. The bright colors on poison frogs are nature's way of warning other animals to stay away. It's their way of saying, hey, I'm poisonous. Don't eat me.

Speaker 1: 09:39 
 Wow. Imagine being a walking warning sign. That's so cool. Okay, what else do we have to learn about today?

Speaker 2: 09:46 
 Wow. We learned about so many incredible animals from that National Geographic little kids magazine. We saw zebras with stripes that confuse flies. Mark horse with their super long twisty horns for climbing mountains. And snow petrels who can hunt for fish in icy water.

Speaker 1: 10:04 
 And don't forget about the snowshoe hare. Oh, yeah, they have those special feet that help them walk on top of the snow without sinking. It's like they have built in snowshoes.

Speaker 2: 10:13 
 That's right. And we can't forget about walruses.

Speaker 1: 10:15 
 Oh. With their big tusks and whiskers that.

Speaker 2: 10:17 
 Are like extra fingers.

Speaker 1: 10:18 
 Exactly.

Speaker 2: 10:19 
 Use those whiskers to find clams under the sand. It's incredible how all these animals have special features.

Speaker 1: 10:24 
 I know, right?

Speaker 2: 10:25 
 That help them survive. From the hot African savanna to the icy cold, Antarctic animals have adapted to all sorts of environments.

Speaker 1: 10:33 
 And we even went on a quick trip to outer space to learn about the super hot planet Venus. Its thick clouds trap the heat from the sun, making it way too hot for us to visit.

Speaker 2: 10:43 
 It's amazing to think about all the different planets and animals that exist in our universe. There's so much to explore and discover.

Speaker 1: 10:50 
 So what was your favorite animal that we learned about today?

Speaker 2: 10:53 
 Hmm, that's a tough one.

Speaker 1: 10:55 
 I know, right? Yeah, there's so many cool ones.

Speaker 2: 10:58 
 But I think my favorite is the snowshoe hare.

Speaker 1: 11:00 
 Oh, the snowshoe hare.

Speaker 2: 11:01 
 It's amazing how they can hop through the snow without sinking.

Speaker 1: 11:04 
 I know.

Speaker 2: 11:05 
 Those big furry feet and the webbing between their toes are such a clever adaptation for living in a snowy place.

Speaker 1: 11:12 
 That's a great choice. I think my favorite is the markhor.

Speaker 2: 11:14 
 The markhor.

Speaker 1: 11:15 
 I love those twisty horns.

Speaker 2: 11:17 
 Yeah, they're pretty cool.

Speaker 1: 11:17 
 It makes them look so unique. I wonder if you could have any animal superpower. What would you choose?

Speaker 2: 11:23 
 Ooh, that's a good question.

Speaker 1: 11:25 
 Would you want to have super speed like a cheetah, the ability to camouflage like a chameleon, or maybe even the power to fly like a bird.

Speaker 2: 11:35 
 So many choices.

Speaker 1: 11:36 
 It's fun to think about. It is what it would be like to have special abilities like animals.

Speaker 2: 11:41 
 Well, that's all the time we have for today's deep dive. But remember, learning about the world around us is an adventure that never ends.

Speaker 1: 11:48 
 So keep exploring and asking questions.

Speaker 2: 11:50 
 You never know what amazing things you might discover.
