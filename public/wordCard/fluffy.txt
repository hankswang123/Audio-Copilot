Imagine a sunny meadow filled with soft, white clouds of fluff floating gently in the air. In the middle, a group of fluffy bunnies with big, round eyes and twitching noses hop around playfully. Their fur looks like cotton candy, and they leave small paw prints on the lush green grass. Nearby, a fluffy golden retriever with a wagging tail watches them with friendly curiosity, adding to the heartwarming scene.
