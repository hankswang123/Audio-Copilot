Imagine a tiny, fragile butterfly resting on the edge of a soft, dewy leaf in the early morning light. The sun gently peeks through the trees, casting a warm glow on the butterfly's intricate wings, which shimmer with pastel colors. Nearby, small drops of morning dew sparkle like tiny diamonds on the leaf's surface, creating a serene and peaceful scene. The air is still, and the gentle rustle of leaves adds to the delicate beauty of this tranquil moment in nature.
