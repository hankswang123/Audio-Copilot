Imagine a mysterious, endless forest where the sun never rises, casting everything in soft moonlight. The trees are tall and twisted, with thick, tangled branches that create eerie shadows on the forest floor. Strange glowing flowers bloom between the roots, lighting up the path for wandering spirits. In the distance, a gentle river flows silently, its waters reflecting the eternal night sky filled with countless stars.
