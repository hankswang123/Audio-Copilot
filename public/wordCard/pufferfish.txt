Imagine a bright underwater world where a cheerful pufferfish floats among colorful coral reefs. The sun's rays dance through the clear blue water, casting playful shadows on the sand below. The pufferfish, with its round, spiky body inflated, looks curious and friendly, surrounded by tiny, darting fish of every color imaginable. Seaweed sways gently in the background, creating a serene and vibrant ocean landscape.
