Imagine a magical forest where every tree glows softly with a golden light, casting a warm and inviting glow over the landscape. In the center of this forest, there is a tranquil pond with crystal-clear water that reflects the shimmering trees. Small, gentle creatures with wings like butterflies flit around, leaving trails of sparkles in the air. The atmosphere is peaceful, with a sense of gentle magic and harmony that makes you feel like you've stepped into a dream.
