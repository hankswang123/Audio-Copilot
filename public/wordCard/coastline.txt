Imagine a bright sunny day along a beautiful coastline, where the golden sand meets the sparkling blue ocean. Waves gently lap against the shore, and seashells are scattered across the beach. In the distance, a lighthouse stands tall on a rocky cliff, guiding ships safely with its glowing light. Palm trees sway in the breeze, and a family is having a picnic, enjoying the view and the sound of seagulls calling overhead.
