Imagine a massive, towering iceberg floating serenely in the vast, deep blue ocean under a clear sky. The iceberg glistens in the bright sunlight, its jagged peaks sparkling like precious gems. Small penguins waddle playfully on its icy surface, while seals lounge lazily nearby. Beneath the water, the iceberg's hidden, mysterious bulk looms, teeming with life and secrets yet to be discovered.
