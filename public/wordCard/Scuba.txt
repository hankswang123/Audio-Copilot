Imagine a vibrant underwater scene filled with colorful coral reefs and playful fish, where a brave scuba diver explores the ocean depths. The sunlight streams through the water, casting shimmering patterns on the sandy ocean floor. The diver, clad in a sleek wetsuit and gear, swims gracefully among swaying seaweed and curious sea creatures. In the distance, a majestic turtle glides peacefully, leaving a trail of tiny bubbles behind.
