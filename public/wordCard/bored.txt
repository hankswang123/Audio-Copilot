Imagine a young girl sitting on a wooden swing in a sunny garden. Her head rests on her hand, and she gazes at the fluffy white clouds in the bright blue sky. Around her, colorful flowers sway gently in the breeze, but she seems lost in her own thoughts. Her dog, lying lazily by her feet, yawns widely, sharing in her boredom under the warm afternoon sun.
