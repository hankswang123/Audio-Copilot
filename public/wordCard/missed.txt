In a small, cozy village, there is a picturesque market bustling with people. Among the vibrant stalls, a little girl in a bright yellow dress stands with a sad expression, looking around for her lost red balloon. The sky is clear and blue, with fluffy clouds floating by, and the sun casts a warm glow over everything. Nearby, a friendly dog watches her curiously, as a gentle breeze rustles the colorful ribbons tied to the market stalls.
