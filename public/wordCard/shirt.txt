Imagine a bright, sunny day in a bustling park where people gather for a colorful festival. In the middle of the scene, a young girl wears a vibrant, oversized shirt with bold, swirling patterns of red, green, and blue. The shirt flutters gently in the breeze, catching the sun's rays and reflecting them like a kaleidoscope. Around her, other festival-goers wear similarly bright and eclectic shirts, creating a lively tapestry of colors against the green grass and blue sky.
