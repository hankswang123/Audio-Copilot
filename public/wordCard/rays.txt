Imagine standing on a sandy beach at sunrise, where soft golden rays of sunlight gently touch the calm ocean waves. The sky is painted with hues of pink, orange, and purple as the sun peeks over the horizon, casting long shadows on the sand. A few seagulls glide gracefully above, their wings illuminated by the warm glow of the early morning light. Nearby, a lighthouse stands tall, its white walls reflecting the sunâ€™s radiant beams, guiding ships safely to shore.
