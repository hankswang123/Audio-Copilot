In a bustling city, a tall, skinny man dressed in a bright yellow suit stands out among the crowd. His clothes hang loosely on his frame, and his long legs move with a graceful stride. Around him, people rush by, but he walks calmly, holding a bright red umbrella that pops against the cloudy sky. The city's lights reflect on the wet pavement, creating a colorful, shimmering path that leads him forward, making his unique silhouette even more striking.
