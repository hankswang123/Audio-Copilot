Imagine a friendly mailman walking down a sunny street in a quiet, picturesque neighborhood. He is dressed in a classic blue uniform with a cap, carrying a large brown mailbag filled with letters and small packages. The street is lined with charming houses, each with a colorful garden and a mailbox at the end of the driveway. Birds are chirping in the trees, and children wave excitedly as the mailman approaches, bringing smiles and anticipation with each delivery.
