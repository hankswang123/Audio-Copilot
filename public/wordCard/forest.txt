Imagine a magical forest where the trees are tall and their leaves are a shimmering mix of green and gold. Sunlight filters through the branches, creating dancing patterns on the forest floor. Friendly woodland creatures like deer, rabbits, and colorful birds wander peacefully among the trees. In the center, a small, sparkling stream flows gently, its water as clear as crystal, inviting you to listen to its soothing melody.
