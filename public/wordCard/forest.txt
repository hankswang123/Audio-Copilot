Imagine a vibrant, lush forest filled with towering trees that stretch high into the sky. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating dancing patterns of light and shadow on the forest floor. A gentle stream winds its way through the trees, its water sparkling like tiny diamonds. Birds flit from branch to branch, their songs mingling with the rustling leaves, while small animals peek out from behind bushes, curious and playful.
