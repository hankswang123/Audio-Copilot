In a cozy, sunlit café, two friends are deep in conversation over steaming cups of coffee. One friend leans forward, eyes wide with curiosity, while the other gestures animatedly, a smile playing on their lips. Around them, the café is alive with the soft murmur of other chats, clinking cups, and the aroma of freshly baked pastries. Outside, a gentle breeze sways the leaves of nearby trees, adding to the scene's warmth and connection.
