Imagine a sunlit forest where colorful birds gather on the branches of ancient oak trees. Each bird has a different type of beak: long, short, curved, and straight, all glistening in the golden rays of the sun. A wise old owl with a sharp, hooked beak watches over the scene from a high perch. The air is filled with the sweet melody of chirping, as the birds use their beaks to sing, eat, and play with one another.
