Imagine a playful scene in a lush, green jungle where a family of zebras with bold black and white stripes is grazing peacefully. Nearby, a cheeky monkey swings from a vine, its fur adorned with natural stripes of sunlight filtering through the leaves. Vibrant butterflies with striped wings flutter around, adding pops of color to the scene. The sunlight dances on the ground, creating striped shadows that mimic the patterns on the animals.
