Imagine a bright, sunny morning in a lush, green forest. A colorful bird, with feathers like a rainbow, perches on a tall tree branch. Its eyes are sparkling with curiosity as it sings a cheerful song, echoing through the woods. The sunlight filters through the leaves, casting playful shadows on the forest floor, while other animals listen to the bird's joyful melody.
