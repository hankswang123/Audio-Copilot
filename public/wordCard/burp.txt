Imagine a cozy kitchen where a little boy sits at a wooden table, giggling after a big burp. The sunlight streams through the window, casting a warm glow on his rosy cheeks. His mother, wearing a bright apron with flower patterns, stands at the stove, smiling and shaking her head playfully. The table is full of colorful plates of delicious food, and a small cat naps nearby, unfazed by the cheerful commotion.
