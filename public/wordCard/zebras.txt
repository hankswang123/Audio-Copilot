In a vast, golden savanna under a bright blue sky, a group of zebras graze peacefully among tall grasses. The sun casts long shadows, creating a striking contrast with their black and white stripes. Nearby, a small watering hole reflects the clear sky, and a few zebras drink from its edge, while others frolic playfully. In the background, acacia trees and distant mountains add depth to this serene, wild landscape.
