Imagine a serene underwater scene where a group of oysters lie nestled in the sandy ocean floor. Sunlight filters through the gentle waves, casting a shimmering glow on the oyster shells, which are a mix of soft pinks, grays, and pearl whites. Tiny fish swim gracefully around, and seagrass sways gently in the current. One oyster is slightly open, revealing a lustrous pearl inside, reflecting the light like a tiny moon in a watery sky.
