Imagine a lush, green rainforest with sunlight streaming through the canopy above, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. In the midst of this vibrant jungle, a blue morpho butterfly flutters gracefully, its wings shimmering in brilliant shades of electric blue. It dances from flower to flower, its iridescent wings catching the light and creating a mesmerizing display. Nearby, a small stream gurgles gently, adding a serene soundtrack to this enchanting scene.
