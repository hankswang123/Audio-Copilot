Imagine a vibrant underwater scene where a lively parrotfish swims gracefully through a colorful coral reef. The parrotfish displays its brilliant hues of turquoise, green, and pink, blending seamlessly with the surrounding corals. Nearby, tiny bubbles rise to the surface as schools of smaller fish dart around, creating a lively and bustling ocean community. Sunlight pierces through the water, casting shimmering patterns on the seafloor and highlighting the intricate details of the coral structures.
