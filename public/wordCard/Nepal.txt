Imagine a breathtaking scene high in the Himalayas, with snow-capped peaks piercing the sky. A colorful prayer flag flutters in the crisp mountain breeze, while a yak calmly grazes in a lush green meadow below. Nearby, a small village of stone houses sits nestled in the valley, with smoke gently rising from chimneys. A group of hikers, bundled in warm jackets, stand in awe, taking in the stunning beauty of Nepal's majestic landscape.
