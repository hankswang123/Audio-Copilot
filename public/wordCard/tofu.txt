Imagine a cozy kitchen filled with warm sunlight streaming through the windows. A wooden cutting board sits on the counter, with a block of fresh tofu resting on it. Beside the tofu, there's a colorful array of fresh vegetables like bright red tomatoes, crisp green bell peppers, and vibrant orange carrots. A gentle breeze carries the scent of herbs, as a pair of hands are seen skillfully chopping the tofu into perfect cubes, ready to create a delicious and healthy meal.
