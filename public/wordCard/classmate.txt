Imagine a bright, sunny classroom filled with colorful decorations and happy students. In the center, two classmates, a girl with curly hair and a boy with glasses, are sitting at a wooden desk, working together on a science project. They are surrounded by books, a globe, and a small plant. Their faces are lit up with excitement as they discuss ideas, and the teacher, standing nearby, smiles proudly at their teamwork.
