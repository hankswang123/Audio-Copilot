Imagine a wise old master sitting in a tranquil Japanese garden. He's surrounded by cherry blossom trees with pink petals gently falling around him. The master wears a flowing robe and holds a small, ancient book filled with secrets. Nearby, a small pond reflects the peaceful scene, with a few colorful koi fish swimming lazily beneath the water. The setting sun casts a warm, golden glow, making the entire scene feel calm and full of wisdom.
