In a vast, starry night sky, Uranus glows with a soft, bluish-green hue, surrounded by its faint, thin rings. Imagine a small spaceship floating nearby, with curious astronauts peering out the windows, fascinated by the planet's unique color and distant moons. The icy surface of Uranus glimmers under the distant sun's light, casting mysterious shadows. In the background, countless stars twinkle, painting a cosmic tapestry that stretches endlessly into the universe.
