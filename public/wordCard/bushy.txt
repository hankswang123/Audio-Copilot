Imagine a lush, green forest where every tree is covered in thick, bushy leaves. The branches are so full that sunlight barely peeks through, casting dappled shadows on the ground below. Small animals, like squirrels and rabbits, scurry around in this dense, leafy haven, finding shelter and food among the bushes. The air is fresh, filled with the earthy scent of damp soil and the soft rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze.
