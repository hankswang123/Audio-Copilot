Imagine a grey, dull room with plain white walls and no windows. In the center of the room, a person sits at a small wooden table, staring at a blank piece of paper. The air feels heavy and still, almost as if time has stopped. The only sound is the quiet ticking of a clock, echoing in the silence, while the person tries to find a spark of creativity in this monotonous space.
