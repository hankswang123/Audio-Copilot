Imagine a tiny, determined ant trying to carry a giant cookie crumb across a vast, sandy desert. The crumb is ten times its size, and the sun blazes brightly in the sky, casting long shadows. The ant's tiny legs strain as it struggles, but it never gives up, showing great perseverance. In the distance, a small oasis with a few palm trees offers a glimmer of hope and a place to rest.
