Imagine a dry, dusty desert floor stretching endlessly under a bright, hot sun. The ground is covered with jagged cracks, forming intricate patterns like a giant puzzle.

In the distance, a lone cactus stands resiliently, its shadow mingling with the maze of cracks below, while a small lizard scurries across, searching for shade.
