Imagine a cozy kitchen filled with the warm smell of freshly baked cookies. A little boy with rosy cheeks is sitting at a wooden table, eagerly munching on a cookie, crumbs scattering everywhere. Sunlight streams through the window, casting a golden glow on the scene. In the background, a friendly dog sits patiently, hoping for a tasty treat to drop.
