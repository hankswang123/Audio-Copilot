Imagine a vast, calm ocean stretching as far as the eye can see, under a bright blue sky. Gentle waves ripple across the water, reflecting the golden light of the setting sun. In the distance, a small, colorful sailboat glides smoothly, its sails billowing in the gentle breeze. Seagulls circle above, their calls echoing softly, while a pod of dolphins playfully leap in and out of the water, creating a joyful and serene scene.
