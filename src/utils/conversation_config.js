    0:00 -> Host
    Kristine, it's really good to have you join us in our studio today.

    0:02
    I'd first like to talk to you about the valuation of SAP that has climbed significantly thanks to AI cloud as well and and your transition from, you know, the legacy model.

    0:15
    How do you expect cloud and AI partnerships to continue driving growth for the company?

    0:20 ->CK
    Yes, indeed.

    0:20
    Yeah, our business is performing extremely well here because customers see that our software is more relevant than ever for their businesses.

    0:28
    No matter if you talk about resiliency of the supply chains or it's about the personalization of their offerings, understanding better their consumers or it's about sustainability, our software really helps them to grow their business.

    0:42
    And now of course, with cloud and business AI, when you have over 400,000 customers, we have most of the business data in the world sits in SAP Systems.

    0:52
    Of course, our business AI is extremely powerful because we can use this data to really embed AI wide into the business processes of our customers to unfold value wide in their day-to-day operations.

    1:05 -> Host
    Indeed, I want to talk to you about the recently held Sapphire customer conference where you know you promised a real productivity boost from AI.

    1:13
    So how is SAP doing that?

    1:16
    What's in it for your customers, for your users as as well as your day-to-day operations at SAP and if you can quantify for me, you know the kind of economic gains one can see from the use of AI.

    1:29 -> CK
    Yeah, so happy to do so.

    1:31
    So first of all, with SAP software, over 300 million users are working every day.

    1:37
    They're doing HR, supply chain, customer related activities, finance related activities with our software.

    1:44
    And in the future, they will not do this anymore by typing data into the system or readings with documents.

    1:51
    At the end, we will have a digital assistant called Joule, which will take over 80% of the day-to-day activities, 80% completely automated also via human language.

    2:02
    Or if you do for example compliance checks in the system, it will be done by our business AI.

    2:07
    Document scanning will be done by business AI.

    2:10
    So over 80% of the task will be completely automated by SAP Business AI.
