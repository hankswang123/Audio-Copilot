Speaker 1: 00:00 
 Hey, everybody. Are you ready for a fun adventure?

Speaker 2: 00:03 
 I am.

Speaker 1: 00:03 
 We're going on a deep dive into two really cool magazines.

Speaker 2: 00:07 
 Ooh. What magazines?

Speaker 1: 00:09 
 National Geographic Kids.

Speaker 2: 00:10 
 Cool.

Speaker 1: 00:11 
 And National Geographic Little Kids.

Speaker 2: 00:13 
 Awesome.

Speaker 1: 00:14 
 We're going to learn all about animals and play some games, too.

Speaker 2: 00:16 
 That sounds like fun.

Speaker 1: 00:17 
 Okay, let's start with this one about cows.

Speaker 2: 00:21 
 Cow.

Speaker 1: 00:22 
 It says that cows moo in different accents.

Speaker 2: 00:25 
 Really?

Speaker 1: 00:25 
 Like if they're from different places.

Speaker 2: 00:27 
 Wow.

Speaker 1: 00:28 
 Can you imagine a cow saying moo with a British accent?

Speaker 2: 00:32 
 Moo.

Speaker 1: 00:33 
 That's so funny.

Speaker 2: 00:34 
 Yes.

Speaker 1: 00:35 
 And there's a maze where you have to help a cow find some yummy grass.

Speaker 2: 00:38 
 I love mazes. They're like little puzzles.

Speaker 1: 00:41 
 Okay, now check this out.

Speaker 2: 00:42 
 What is it?

Speaker 1: 00:43 
 A whole page about orange foods. Mmm.

Speaker 2: 00:45 
 I love orange foods. I like oranges.

Speaker 1: 00:48 
 Of course.

Speaker 2: 00:48 
 Pumpkins and carrots.

Speaker 1: 00:50 
 Those are good for your eyes.

Speaker 2: 00:52 
 That's right.

Speaker 1: 00:53 
 And mangoes.

Speaker 2: 00:54 
 So sweet.

Speaker 1: 00:54 
 I love mangoes.

Speaker 2: 00:55 
 Me, too.

Speaker 1: 00:56 
 There's also a game where you have to spot the difference between two pictures.

Speaker 2: 00:59 
 Like a detective.

Speaker 1: 01:00 
 Exactly.

Speaker 2: 01:01 
 I'm good at finding differences.

Speaker 1: 01:02 
 Me, too.

Speaker 2: 01:03 
 It's all about paying attention.

Speaker 1: 01:04 
 Now, let me introduce you to a very special animal.

Speaker 2: 01:07 
 Ooh, I love animals.

Speaker 1: 01:09 
 It's called an okapi.

Speaker 2: 01:11 
 An okapi.

Speaker 1: 01:12 
 It looks like a giraffe with stripes. Yes. Like a zebra.

Speaker 2: 01:16 
 Wow.

Speaker 1: 01:16 
 It lives in the rainforest and it has a super long tongue.

Speaker 2: 01:19 
 What does it use its tongue for?

Speaker 1: 01:21 
 To reach the leaves high up in the trees.

Speaker 2: 01:23 
 That's clever.

Speaker 1: 01:25 
 And guess what? Baby okapis can talk to their moms with special sounds.

Speaker 2: 01:30 
 Really?

Speaker 1: 01:30 
 Other animals can't even hear them.

Speaker 2: 01:32 
 That's like a secret language I know, right? So cool.

Speaker 1: 01:35 
 Let's talk about stripes.

Speaker 2: 01:36 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 01:36 
 This activity shows different animals with stripes.

Speaker 2: 01:39 
 Like zebras.

Speaker 1: 01:40 
 Yes. And okapis. And bongos.

Speaker 2: 01:43 
 They all have stripes, but they're all different.

Speaker 1: 01:45 
 That's right. Every animal is unique.

Speaker 2: 01:47 
 Just like us.

Speaker 1: 01:48 
 Now get ready to be amazed by jumping spiders.

Speaker 2: 01:50 
 Jumping spiders?

Speaker 1: 01:51 
 They can jump super high.

Speaker 2: 01:53 
 How high?

Speaker 1: 01:53 
 Over a magazine.

Speaker 2: 01:55 
 Wow.

Speaker 1: 01:55 
 They have eight eyes. Eight. And each eye has a different job.

Speaker 2: 01:59 
 That's incredible.

Speaker 1: 02:00 
 For, like, tiny superheroes.

Speaker 2: 02:01 
 I want to see one.

Speaker 1: 02:02 
 They're really good at catching bugs.

Speaker 2: 02:04 
 How do they do that?

Speaker 1: 02:05 
 They sneak up on them and then pounce.

Speaker 2: 02:07 
 Like a surprise attack.

Speaker 1: 02:08 
 Exactly. They're very sneaky.

Speaker 2: 02:10 
 Awesome. And they don't even use webs.

Speaker 1: 02:12 
 Nope. They're too cool for webs.

Speaker 2: 02:14 
 So how do they catch bugs?

Speaker 1: 02:16 
 Or try some tongue twisters.

Speaker 2: 02:17 
 Sure.

Speaker 1: 02:18 
 Okay, try this one. Bites tree, licks bees.

Speaker 2: 02:22 
 Bites tree, licks bees.

Speaker 1: 02:25 
 Which animal do you think that Is a bear?

Speaker 2: 02:28 
 Nope, it's a giraffe. Oh, yeah. Giraffes have long tongues.

Speaker 1: 02:31 
 Okay. Ready for another animal?

Speaker 2: 02:33 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 02:33 
 This one is called an ocelot.

Speaker 2: 02:35 
 An ocelot? What's that?

Speaker 1: 02:37 
 It's a wild cat with spots and stripes.

Speaker 2: 02:39 
 Wow, that's cool.

Speaker 1: 02:41 
 And blobby shapes on its fur.

Speaker 2: 02:43 
 Blobby shapes?

Speaker 1: 02:44 
 Yeah, it's like it has all the patterns.

Speaker 2: 02:46 
 So it can hide really well.

Speaker 1: 02:48 
 Exactly. It's like camouflage.

Speaker 2: 02:49 
 It's like a jungle superhero.

Speaker 1: 02:51 
 And guess what? Ocelots can climb down trees head first.

Speaker 2: 02:54 
 Head first?

Speaker 1: 02:55 
 Like squirrels.

Speaker 2: 02:56 
 That's crazy.

Speaker 1: 02:57 
 They're pretty amazing.

Speaker 2: 02:58 
 I know. There's so many cool animals.

Speaker 1: 03:01 
 And there are more spotted cats, too.

Speaker 2: 03:02 
 Like cheetahs.

Speaker 1: 03:03 
 Yep. And black footed cats. And fishing cats.

Speaker 2: 03:07 
 So many spots.

Speaker 1: 03:08 
 It's like a spotty cat club.

Speaker 2: 03:09 
 Let's play a game.

Speaker 1: 03:10 
 Okay. What game?

Speaker 2: 03:11 
 It's called inside out.

Speaker 1: 03:13 
 How do you play?

Speaker 2: 03:14 
 We have to guess if an animal is on top of something or inside something.

Speaker 1: 03:19 
 Okay. Get it.

Speaker 2: 03:19 
 Like a bird in a nest that's inside.

Speaker 1: 03:21 
 And a cat on a roof. That's on top.

Speaker 2: 03:24 
 You got it.

Speaker 1: 03:24 
 It's fun.

Speaker 2: 03:25 
 Okay, now it's your turn.

Speaker 1: 03:26 
 All right, let me think. A raccoon in a trash can.

Speaker 2: 03:31 
 That's on top.

Speaker 1: 03:32 
 Correct.

Speaker 2: 03:33 
 Your turn.

Speaker 1: 03:33 
 A polar bear in its den.

Speaker 2: 03:35 
 That's inside.

Speaker 1: 03:36 
 You're good at this game.

Speaker 2: 03:37 
 Thanks. I like animals.

Speaker 1: 03:39 
 Me too.

Speaker 2: 03:39 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 03:40 
 Okay. Let's talk about another cool animal.

Speaker 2: 03:42 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 03:43 
 Have you ever seen an armadillo?

Speaker 2: 03:46 
 They have those hard shells.

Speaker 1: 03:48 
 Yeah. And they can roll up into a ball.

Speaker 2: 03:50 
 Like a little ball of armor.

Speaker 1: 03:51 
 And so they can protect themselves.

Speaker 2: 03:53 
 That's smart.

Speaker 1: 03:54 
 I know, right?

Speaker 2: 03:54 
 What else can they do?

Speaker 1: 03:55 
 Well, they like to dig.

Speaker 2: 03:57 
 For what?

Speaker 1: 03:57 
 For food. They eat bugs and grubs. I know it sounds gross, but it's yummy for them.

Speaker 2: 04:04 
 Okay, let's do something else.

Speaker 1: 04:05 
 Like what?

Speaker 2: 04:06 
 I want to go on a treasure hunt.

Speaker 1: 04:07 
 Oh, me too. Let's look in this magazine.

Speaker 2: 04:10 
 Is there a treasure map?

Speaker 1: 04:11 
 There is.

Speaker 2: 04:12 
 Look.

Speaker 1: 04:13 
 It's a pirate scene. We have to find a treasure chest.

Speaker 2: 04:16 
 And sea stars and a telescope. What treasures would you put in your chest?

Speaker 1: 04:21 
 Jewels and gold coins.

Speaker 2: 04:22 
 And maybe a magic lamp.

Speaker 1: 04:24 
 That'd be cool.

Speaker 2: 04:25 
 I want to be a pirate.

Speaker 1: 04:26 
 Arc, matey.

Speaker 2: 04:27 
 Oh, There.

Speaker 1: 04:28 
 Okay, let's go back in time to the time of the dinosaurs. This dinosaur is called Minmi.

Speaker 2: 04:34 
 Minmi. What a funny name.

Speaker 1: 04:36 
 I know. It was a plant eater.

Speaker 2: 04:38 
 Did it have big teeth?

Speaker 1: 04:39 
 Nope. Small and sharp for biting off plants.

Speaker 2: 04:43 
 And it had armor?

Speaker 1: 04:44 
 Yep. All over his body. Like a Walking tank.

Speaker 2: 04:47 
 That's awesome.

Speaker 1: 04:48 
 Now let's travel to a faraway place.

Speaker 2: 04:50 
 Where are we going?

Speaker 1: 04:50 
 To Sri Lanka.

Speaker 2: 04:52 
 Sri Lanka. Where's that?

Speaker 1: 04:53 
 It's an island in the Indian Ocean.

Speaker 2: 04:55 
 Wow. That sounds exotic.

Speaker 1: 04:57 
 It has beautiful beaches and ancient temples.

Speaker 2: 05:00 
 And animals, of course.

Speaker 1: 05:02 
 Lots of amazing animals.

Speaker 2: 05:03 
 Cool.

Speaker 1: 05:04 
 Do you know how to say hello in Sri Lanka?

Speaker 2: 05:06 
 Nope.

Speaker 1: 05:07 
 You say Ayubowon.

Speaker 2: 05:08 
 Ayubu1.

Speaker 1: 05:10 
 That's pretty. There's a special rock in Sri Lanka called Lion Rock.

Speaker 2: 05:14 
 Why is it called Lion Rock?

Speaker 1: 05:16 
 Because it looked like a giant lion.

Speaker 2: 05:18 
 Wow.

Speaker 1: 05:18 
 There's an old palace on top. Yep. From a long time ago.

Speaker 2: 05:22 
 That's so cool.

Speaker 1: 05:23 
 And there's a park called Yala National Park.

Speaker 2: 05:25 
 What kind of animals live there?

Speaker 1: 05:26 
 Leopards.

Speaker 2: 05:27 
 Leopards? Those are my favorite.

Speaker 1: 05:29 
 Mine too. They're so graceful. And they have spots just like our spotty cat club.

Speaker 2: 05:34 
 We should start a leopard club.

Speaker 1: 05:35 
 Great idea.

Speaker 2: 05:36 
 What else can you see in Sri Lanka?

Speaker 1: 05:38 
 You can see fishermen balancing on stilts in the water.

Speaker 2: 05:41 
 Stilts?

Speaker 1: 05:42 
 Yeah, like long poles.

Speaker 2: 05:43 
 Why do they do that?

Speaker 1: 05:44 
 So they can reach the fish.

Speaker 2: 05:46 
 That sounds hard.

Speaker 1: 05:47 
 It does take a lot of balance.

Speaker 2: 05:48 
 They must be really good at it.

Speaker 1: 05:50 
 They are. Let's climb a mountain.

Speaker 2: 05:52 
 Okay. Which one?

Speaker 1: 05:53 
 Adam's Peak. It's a special mountain in Sri Lanka.

Speaker 2: 05:56 
 Why is it special?

Speaker 1: 05:57 
 Lots of people climb it at night.

Speaker 2: 05:59 
 At night?

Speaker 1: 06:00 
 So we can see the stars while they walk.

Speaker 2: 06:01 
 That sounds magical.

Speaker 1: 06:03 
 It does.

Speaker 2: 06:03 
 I want to climb a mountain at night.

Speaker 1: 06:05 
 Me too.

Speaker 2: 06:05 
 Okay, let's play another game.

Speaker 1: 06:07 
 What game?

Speaker 2: 06:07 
 True or false.

Speaker 1: 06:08 
 About what about?

Speaker 2: 06:09 
 About animals from Sri Lanka.

Speaker 1: 06:10 
 Right. I'm ready.

Speaker 2: 06:11 
 Okay. True or false? The sloth bear has a pink nose.

Speaker 1: 06:18 
 I don't know.

Speaker 2: 06:19 
 Think about it.

Speaker 1: 06:20 
 I think it's false.

Speaker 2: 06:20 
 You're right.

Speaker 1: 06:21 
 Yay.

Speaker 2: 06:22 
 Okay, next one. True or false? The slender loris lives in trees.

Speaker 1: 06:28 
 That's true.

Speaker 2: 06:28 
 Correct.

Speaker 1: 06:29 
 I'm good at this game.

Speaker 2: 06:30 
 Okay, last one. True or false? The Sri Lankan jungle fowl can fly.

Speaker 1: 06:37 
 Jungle fowl. Is that a bird?

Speaker 2: 06:39 
 Yes.

Speaker 1: 06:40 
 Then it must be true.

Speaker 2: 06:41 
 You got it.

Speaker 1: 06:42 
 Wow. We learned so much about animals.

Speaker 2: 06:44 
 And about Sri Lanka.

Speaker 1: 06:46 
 It's a cool place.

Speaker 2: 06:47 
 I know, right? With beaches and temples and mountains. We should go there someday.

Speaker 1: 06:51 
 That would be an awesome adventure.

Speaker 2: 06:52 
 Yeah. We could see all the animals in real life.

Speaker 1: 06:55 
 What was your favorite part?

Speaker 2: 06:57 
 It's hard to choose.

Speaker 1: 06:58 
 I know. It was so much cool stuff.

Speaker 2: 07:01 
 I think I like the okapi the.

Speaker 1: 07:02 
 Best with its secret language.

Speaker 2: 07:04 
 Yeah. That was amazing.

Speaker 1: 07:05 
 Mine was the treasure hunt.

Speaker 2: 07:07 
 Oh, yeah. Pirates are so much fun.

Speaker 1: 07:09 
 Ahoy there.

Speaker 2: 07:10 
 Chevermead. Timbers.

Speaker 1: 07:11 
 We learned about dinosaurs too.

Speaker 2: 07:13 
 Minmi was so cool with its armor. It was like a walking tank.

Speaker 1: 07:17 
 I'm glad we went on this deep dive.

Speaker 2: 07:18 
 Me too. It was so much fun.

Speaker 1: 07:20 
 Learning new things is always an adventure.

Speaker 2: 07:22 
 And these magazines were full of surprises.

Speaker 1: 07:24 
 If you could have any animal as a pet, which one would you choose?

Speaker 2: 07:30 
 That's a tough one.

Speaker 1: 07:31 
 There are so many to choose from.

Speaker 2: 07:32 
 I think I would pick a dolphin.

Speaker 1: 07:34 
 A dolphin?

Speaker 2: 07:35 
 They're so playful and smart and they.

Speaker 1: 07:37 
 Live in the ocean.

Speaker 2: 07:38 
 Yeah. We could swim together.

Speaker 1: 07:40 
 That would be amazing.

Speaker 2: 07:41 
 What about you?

Speaker 1: 07:43 
 I would choose a monkey.

Speaker 2: 07:44 
 A monkey?

Speaker 1: 07:44 
 Yeah. We could swing through the trees and eat bananas and make funny faces.

Speaker 2: 07:49 
 That sounds like a lot of fun.

Speaker 1: 07:51 
 It does this well. That's all for our deep dive today.

Speaker 2: 07:54 
 Thanks for joining us.

Speaker 1: 07:56 
 We hope you had a great time exploring with us.

Speaker 2: 07:58 
 Keep learning and have fun.

Speaker 1: 07:59 
 Bye, everyone.
